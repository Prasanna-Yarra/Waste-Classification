# Waste-Classification using Resnet50


Waste management is a big problem in the world. Most of the wastes end up in landfills. The world generates at least 3.5 million tons of waste per day and this number is still increasing day by day that's why we need to aware about waste.
This leads to many issues like

* Increase in landfills
* Eutrophication
* Consumption of toxic waste by animals
* Increase in toxins
* Land, water and air pollution

APPROACH

* Analysed the components of household waste
* Segregated into two classes (Organic and recyclable)
* Reduce toxic waste ending in landfills
* This will help to raise awareness for people to reduce and recycle waste


# Data Source
* In this project I have taken dataset from Kaggle.

# Overview
* Here I have trained dataset using Resnet50 CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) architecture
* The testing data was classified with 87% accuracy
